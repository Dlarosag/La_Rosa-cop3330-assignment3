Even after some research I still have a hard time dealing with JSON archives, but I believe I have gathered enought information to compleate thi program.
After setting the JSON parser and objects, I will implement a while loop that will run as long as there is not an existing product that matches the input.
Once I have understood the nature of JSON files, this program will be similar to one where instead of reading a JSON file, it will work like looking for an item in a file or list: A loop that once it has found a match it will break;
